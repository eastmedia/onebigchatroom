== One Big Chat Room

Use foreman in the dev environment to start up the faye server.
So run ```>foreman start```


== Running Faye in Production

We are being dumb/pragmatic and running it on port 443 for now because EY has port 9292 blocked.
We should also look into a good way to start / stop on deploy instead of periodically
having to log into the server and run @nohup sudo bundle exec thin start -R faye.ru -p 443 2> /dev/null &@**

If You Want To Run This In Production you'll want to edit @config.faye_password@ in "application.rb":https://github.com/eastmedia/onebigchatroom/blob/master/config/application.rb
